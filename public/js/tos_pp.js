The tagSurf Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, these Terms. </div> <div> <span class=\"bold big\">8.2 Additional Terms.</span> Your use of the Service is subject to any and all additional terms, policies, rules or guidelines applicable to the Service or certain features of the Service that we may post on or link to on the Service (the \"Additional Terms\"), such as end-user license agreements for any downloadable applications that we may offer, or rules applicable to particular features or content on the Service.

We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim. </div> <div class=\"bold biggest\"> 11. Disclaimers; No Warranties </div> <div> THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND ON AN \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE TAGSURF ENTITIES SPECIFICALLY (BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO (i) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (ii) ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE. THE TAGSURF ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PART THEREOF, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED. </div> <div> NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE TAGSURF ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR ALL DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE, YOUR DEALINGS WITH MERCHANTS AND OTHER SERVICE USERS, AND ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE SERVICE AND USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIALS OR CONTENT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COUPONS) THROUGH THE SERVICE AND ANY ASSOCIATED SITES OR SERVICES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF SUCH MATERIALS OR CONTENT. </div> <div> SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. </div> <div class=\"bold biggest\"> 12.

ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. Each provision of these terms that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages is to allocate the risks under these terms between the parties. This allocation is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between the parties. Each of these provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions of these terms. The limitations in this section 12 will apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose. </div> <div class=\"bold biggest\"> 13. Governing Law </div> <div> These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and tagSurf agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. </div> <div class=\"bold biggest\"> 14. General </div> <div> These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and tagSurf regarding your use of and access to the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 1, 2, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4, 9 through 15, 16 and the Privacy Policy. </div> <div class=\"bold biggest\"> 15. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration </div> <div> <span class=\"bold big\">15.1 Generally.</span> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and tagSurf in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and tagSurf agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TAGSURF ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. </div> <div> <span class=\"bold big\">15.2 Exceptions.</span> Notwithstanding subsection 15.1, tagSurf and you agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims. </div> <div> <span class=\"bold big\">15.3 Arbitrator.</span> Any arbitration between you and tagSurf will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting tagSurf. </div> <div> <span class=\"bold big\">15.4 Notice; Process.</span> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\"). tagSurf's address for Notice is: tagSurf Corp., PO Box 641384, San Francisco, CA 94164. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or tagSurf may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or tagSurf shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, tagSurf shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by tagSurf in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. </div> <div> <span class=\"bold big\">15.5 Fees.</span> In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, tagSurf will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Madison, WI provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse tagSurf for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. </div> <div> <span class=\"bold big\">15.6 No Class Actions.</span> YOU AND TAGSURF AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and tagSurf agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. </div> <div> <span class=\"bold big\">15.7 Modifications.</span> In the event that tagSurf makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to tagSurf's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to tagSurf's address for Notice, in which case your account with tagSurf shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive. </div> <div> <span class=\"bold big\">15.8 Enforceability.</span> If Subsection 15.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms. </div> <div class=\"bold biggest\"> 16. Modification of the Terms </div> <div> tagSurf reserves the right to update or modify the Terms at any time without prior notice, and such changes will be effective immediately upon being posted through the Service, except as set forth below. These Terms will identify the date of last update. Your use of the Service following any such change constitutes your agreement to be bound by the modified Terms of Use. In the case of material changes to the Terms, tagSurf will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change, such as through sending an email to any address you may have used to register for an account, through a pop-up window on the Service, or other similar mechanism. Material changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of: (i) your first use of the Service with actual notice of such change, or (ii) thirty (30) days from posting of such change. Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the version of the Terms in place at the time the dispute arose. We encourage you to review these Terms frequently to stay informed of the latest modifications. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no modification to the terms of our agreement to arbitrate disputes will be effective without your express consent, provided that if we propose a change to the terms of our agreement to arbitrate and you do not consent to the change, you must terminate your use of the Service. </div> <div class=\"bold biggest\"> 17.

If we combine or associate information from other sources with PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION that we collect through tagSurf’s websites, we will treat the combined information as PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. </div> <div> tagSurf does not disclose PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in many website-related activities. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Aggregated Statistics </div> <div> tagSurf may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, tagSurf may monitor the most popular content on the tagSurf.co site or use screening services to prevent the upload of spam or Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content to tagSurf. tagSurf may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, TAGSURF DOES NOT DISCLOSE PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OTHER THAN AS DESCRIBED BELOW. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Protection of Certain PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION </div> <div> tagSurf discloses potentially personally identifiable and PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on tagSurf’s behalf or to provide services available at tagSurf’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using tagSurf’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. TAGSURF WILL NOT RENT OR SELL POTENTIALLY PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE AND PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO ANYONE. </div> <div> OTHER THAN TO ITS EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, TAGSURF ONLY DISCLOSES POTENTIALLY PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE AND PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO A SUBPOENA, COURT ORDER OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REQUEST, OR WHEN TAGSURF BELIEVES IN GOOD FAITH THAT DISCLOSURE IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE PROPERTY OR RIGHTS OF TAGSURF, THIRD PARTIES OR THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. </div> <div> If you are a registered user of a tagSurf website and have supplied your email address, tagSurf may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with tagSurf and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. tagSurf takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally identifiable and personally identifiable information. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Anonymity </div> <div> Protecting user anonymity is a top priority at tagSurf. tagSurf does not disclose any PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION to non-administrative users of tagSurf websites except as documented by this privacy policy. Any links between your user account and your activity on tagSurf sites are protected through a secure separation on our servers, the key to which is only made available to select tagSurf employees and contractors for use in developing and troubleshooting our services. </div> <div> If you knowingly use your tagSurf account to upload NSFW content, engage in cyber-bullying, or use tagSurf to participate in illegal activities, you waive all anonymity protection and acknowledge that in such cases we may publicly disclose some or all of your account activity in association with your PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION as is necessary to cooperate with law enforcement entities or otherwise stop such behavior as quickly as possible. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Cookies </div> <div> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. tagSurf uses cookies to help tagSurf identify and track visitors, their usage of tagSurf website, and their website access preferences. tagSurf visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using tagSurf’s websites, with the drawback that most features of tagSurf’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies used to authenticate server requests. </div> <div> tagSurf may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “Pixel Tags”) in connection with our services to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Business Transfers </div> <div> If tagSurf, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that tagSurf goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of tagSurf may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Ads </div> <div> Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by tagSurf and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> No Children under 13 </div> <div> Although we welcome users from all walks of life, our site is not aimed at children, and the United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Individuals under the age of 13 may not create an account with us. If you believe someone 12 or younger is using our site without parental consent, please contact us at <a class=\"blue\" href=\"mailto:beta@tagSurf.co\">beta@tagSurf.co</a>. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Links to Other Sites </div> <div> Our websites contain links to other websites and online services.  If you choose to visit a third party service or an advertiser by “clicking on” a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website or online service.  The fact that we link to a website, content or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.  Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites and services you use.  We do not exercise control over third party websites or services. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Publishing to Other Sites </div> <div> Some tagSurf sites may allow you to upload content for publishing or hosting under your accounts at third party websites and social networks. Content uploaded to third party services through tagSurf is subject to the privacy policies and terms of use of these services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites and services you use.  We do not exercise control over third party websites or services. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Security Measures </div> <div> Although tagSurf will take reasonable precautions to keep your PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION private, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the tagSurf. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> International Visitors </div> <div> tagSurf’s services are hosted in the United States and are intended for visitors located within the United States. If you choose to access our services from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the websites. By providing any information, including PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, to tagSurf you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Privacy Policy Changes </div> <div> Although most changes are likely to be minor, tagSurf may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in tagSurf’s sole discretion. tagSurf encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification the first time you visit a tagSurf website after such material changes are made. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change. </div> <div class=\"bold\"> Our Contact Information </div> <div> Please contact us with any questions or comments about this Policy, your personal information, our use and disclosure practices, or your consent choices by email at <a class=\"blue\" href=\"mailto:beta@tagSurf.co\">beta@tagSurf.co</a>. </div> <div> PO Box 641384 <br> San Francisco, CA 94164 </div> </div> <div class=\"bigger bottom\"> <div class=\"forward button\">Close</div> </div> </div> </div>";
