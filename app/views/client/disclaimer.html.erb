  Welcome to tagSurf Private Beta.
 </div>
 <div>
  tagSurf is an app that lets you anonymously discover, rank and share social content by hashtags.
 </div>
 <div>
  You are signing up for a private beta version, which is still undergoing testing and development before its official public release.
 </div>
 <div>
  On the next page, you'll be asked to agree to a beta test agreement, which includes a non-disclosure agreement, before activating your account. CONFIDENTIALITY is very important during this stage of development, so please don't show or discuss tagSurf with ANYONE who's not a member of our beta program.
 </div>
 <div>
  We're working hard to support all browsers and platforms. At this time, tagSurf performs best in mobile Safari on an iPhone 5.
 </div>
 <div>
  Should you encounter bugs, glitches, lack of functionality or other problems with tagSurf, please tell us about it at beta@tagSurf.co.
